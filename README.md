# dino_term
dino_term is a rendition of he chrome dinosour game developed in C that lives in your terminal. I'm developing a basic game engine in C that leverages the ncurses library to handle terminal rendering in ascii characters. I'm currently developing a few demos as I work on basic pysics and mechanics. 

# Running the Demo
dino_term is built using make. You can run the demo on your POSIX system by cloning the repository and running the following two commands:
``` console
user@machine:~/dino_term$ make
user@machine:~/dino_term$ ./dino_term
```

dino_term is a working title and I'm open to suggestions

# Progress
There is currently a framework that provides basic physics and user input. The next step is to use these tools to implement the game mechanics

# Blooper Reel
It's important to learn from lifes mistakes so you can gain the satisfaction of looking back and laughing once you manage to overcome them. Here are some funny glitches from a few times I messed up during development.
