# Cowbot
Cowbot is an interactive buddy that lives in your terminal developed in C. Cowbot is a working title as I am still currently developing a game engine in C that leverages the ncurses library to handle terminal rendering in ascii characters. I'm currently developing a few demos as I work on basic pysics and mechanics.

# Running the Demo
Cowbot is build with make. You can run the demo on your POSIX system by cloning the repository and running the following two commands:
``` console
user@machine:~/cowbot$ make
user@machine:~/cowbot$ ./cowbot
```
